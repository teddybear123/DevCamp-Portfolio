                <h5>About My Life</h5>
                <p>I am 17 years old. I live in Utah but I am originally from Tacoma, Washington. I am now a senior in high school
                and I attend Highland High School in South Salt Lake.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Why did I decide to become a developer?</h5>
                <p>I first decided I wanted to become a developer and a programmer when I was in 8th grade. My grade went 
                    on a tour of the college campus we would be transported to if we took classes there and coding was one
                    of the classes and they showed this awesome video that I still watch every now and again to this day.
                </p>
                
                <h4>ANYONE CAN DO IT, IF YOU JUST BELIEVE</h4>
                <p>I am not going to lie, programming is not an easy task. But if you stick to it and you push yourself to 
                    do the best you can, you can achieve great and amazing things in this world.</p>
